This project “TRAVEL AND TOURISM MANAGEMENT” is used to automate all 

process of the travel and tourism, which deals with creation, booking and confirmation and user 

details. The project is designed HTML-PHP as front end and Microsoft SQL Server 2008 as 

backend which works in any browsers. The coding language used HTML and PHP. Travel and 

tourism management system is used to book a tour from anywhere in the world by a single dynamic 

website which will help the user to know all about the places and tour details in a single website. 

The admin can add packages to the website from a certain travel agents and hotels by create a tour 

page. Then the users can sign in and book each project, they can be confirmed by the admin in their 

manage booking page. The user can see the confirmation in their my booking page. It is an easiest 

platform for all travelers which can be easily booked and know the all details.

 Tourism management system is online system which help tourists to access available 

packages and book without accessing offices and they have features of tracking and controlling 

their bookings, accessing tour history, password and profile update . The objective of this project 

is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities of a travel agency. In this project, 

We will make an easier task of searching places and for booking train, flight or bus. . In the present 

system a customer has to approach various agencies to find details of places and to book tickets. 

This often requires a lot of time and effort. We provide approach skills to critically examine how a 

tourist visits and its ability to operate in an appropriate way when dealing with the consequences 

of tourism, locally, regionally, and nationally including visitor security and ecological influences. 

It is tedious for a customer to plan a particular journey and have it executed properly. The project 

‘Tours and Travels Management System’ is developed to replace the currently existing system, 

which helps in keeping records of the customer details of destination as well as payment received.

This system also helps to promote responsible and interesting tourism so that people can 

enjoy their holidays at their favorable places. This system also helps to develop tourism with 

different cultures so that they enrich the tourism experience and build pride. We develop this system 

to create and promote forms of tourism that provide healthy interaction opportunities for tourists 

and locals and increase better understanding of different cultures, customs, lifestyles, traditional 

knowledge and believes. This system also provide a better way to connect with various events.
